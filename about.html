      <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        The Healthy Buildings Network Leeds (HBN) emerged from a cross-disciplinary 
        effort at the University of Leeds to explore how buildings impact human 
        health, well-being, and sustainability—both locally in Yorkshire and 
        worldwide. We bring together academics, industry partners, policymakers, 
        and community members to tackle indoor environmental challenges through 
        research, collaboration, and education.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since our founding, HBN has hosted seminars featuring renowned experts—such 
        as <strong>Liora, Chuck, and Pete Apps (Grenfell)</strong>—to engage 
        diverse audiences. We also provide pump-priming grants that have 
        already funded four innovative projects, pushing the boundaries of 
        healthy building science.

      <h2 class="section-title">Our Mission & Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission is to create healthier indoor environments for everyone. 
        We envision a future where building design and operations are driven 
        by evidence-based approaches that promote physical and mental well-being, 
        energy efficiency, and climate resilience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through collective expertise—spanning architecture, engineering, 
        public health, environmental science, and social sciences—we strive 
        to share knowledge, influence policy, and spark innovation that 
        improves the quality of life in all built environments.
